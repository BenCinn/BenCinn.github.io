### Small note: I never use Next.js before writing this website so please take this as a grain salt.

Today we're gonna build a blog using Next.js with Markdown, We're gonna start at building a working one first, and then we're gonna style it using **Tailwind CSS**! Not wasting any time, Let's jump right in!  

## Create working samples
First, I create a next app using `npx create-next-app@latest` and then install some packages
```json:package.json
"dependencies": {
    "markdown-it": "^13.0.1",
    "markdown-it-highlightjs": "^4.0.1",
    "next": "12.1.6",
    "next-themes": "^0.2.0",
    "nightwind": "^1.1.12",
    "react": "18.1.0",
    "react-dom": "18.1.0",
    "typewriter-effect": "^2.18.2"
  },
```
